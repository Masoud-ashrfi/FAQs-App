### What I learned

What I Learned from My Project
Dynamic Content Interaction:

Hide/Show Functionality: Implementing the ability to hide and show answers by clicking on questions taught me how to manage dynamic content visibility. This involves manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, handling events, and understanding how to toggle classes for showing or hiding elements.
Keyboard Navigation Accessibility:

Keyboard Navigation: Enabling users to navigate through questions and toggle answers using only the keyboard helped me understand the importance of accessibility. It reinforced the need to ensure that interactive elements are focusable and respond to keyboard events, such as Enter or Space, which are crucial for users who rely on keyboards for navigation.
Responsive Design:

Responsive Layouts: Ensuring the interface adapts to different screen sizes taught me about responsive design principles. Using CSS media queries and flexible layouts allowed me to create a design that looks good on various devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens. This experience deepened my understanding of how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating adaptive layouts.
Styling Interactive Elements:

Hover and Focus States: Implementing hover and focus states for interactive elements improved my knowledge of CSS pseudo-classes like :hover and :focus. This practice highlighted the importance of providing visual feedback to users, which enhances usability and ensures that the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.
Project Integration and Testing:

Combining Skills: Integrating these features into a single project helped me see how different aspects of frontend development come together. It reinforced the importance of thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work seamlessly and meet accessibility standards.
Overall, this project enhanced my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and responsive web design, while also emphasizing the importance of accessibility and user experience in web development.
